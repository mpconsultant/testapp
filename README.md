# testapp

To run a test copy the war file "ngdemo.war" from target folder to a local direrctory and 
deploy it on an application server [e.g. on tomcat/jboss/weblogic/was/jetty etc..]

After a successful deployment use a 'url' with folllowing naming convention

http://hostname:port/ngdemo/index.html

For example : If deployed on  tomcat server, may use 

http://localhost:8080/ngdemo/index.html
